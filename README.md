# Audio Recognition System for Drone Detection
* Designed and developed a real-time audio analysis system to detect the presence of drones.
* Implemented a low-pass filter and integrated it with a microphone for accurate audio signal processing.
* Utilized PyTorch to train a neural network model for drone detection and converted audio to melSpectrogram,achieving an accuracy rate of 94%.

## Future Work
* Implementing the system to make a physical prototype.
* Using different and better microphone technologies
* Using different low-pass filters and butterworth filters.
* Using other architecture formats and hyperparameter values for the machine learning model.
